                <p>
                  Originally from a small town in the West Midlands, I decided
                  to move to Bristol shortly after a stint living in Cardiff
                  following on from university. I have never looked back since
                  and I absolutely cannot imagine living anywhere else.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I currently work at Zone - working with Vue, CSS and JS,
                  mostly. I love my job and try to give back to the community by
                  mentoring at both Codebar and a local Bristol high school.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I love being outdoors - I'm really into running, cycling and
                  swimming. I've ran a handful of half marathons, a full
                  marathon and I'm doing a Triathlon later this year (which is
                  held in the Avon, so wish me luck with the swimming!). I also
                  love video games - I'm a Playstation gal usually but have been
                  playing a lot of my Switch recently. In a post-pandemic world
                  you can usually find me at gigs in and around Bristol.
