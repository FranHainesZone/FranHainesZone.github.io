                <p>
                  Originally from a small town in the West Midlands, I decided
                  to move to Bristol shortly after a stint living in Cardiff.
                  I've never looked back since and I absolutely cannot imagine
                  living anywhere else.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I work at Zone and I'm currently working with Vue, CSS and JS.
                  I love my job and try to give back to the community by
                  mentoring at both Codebar and a local Bristol high school.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I love being outdoors - I'm really into running, cycling and
                  swimming. I've ran a handful of half marathons, a full
                  marathon and I'm doing my first Triathlon later this year. I
                  also love video games (Switch and Playstation) and reading
                  (mainly feminism, sociology and sci-fi). In a post-pandemic
                  world you can usually find me at gigs in and around Bristol.
